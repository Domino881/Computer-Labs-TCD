Page limit: 6 pages (excluding title page). Appendix with additional figures is optional.
Please upload a pdf of your report through Blackboard. You may use Word, Latex, or other software of your choosing to prepare the report.
The lab report should include:

A brief summary of the method you use to find the energy eigenstates. Show and explain a snippet of your code that implements this method.

Plots of (a few - doesn't have to be all) normalised eigenfunctions. Please ensure plots are presented properly including axis labels.

Table with energy eigenstates of both the square well (+analytic solutions) and harmonic potential. Clearly state the accuracy of your results.

Table or plot with computed uncertainty relations for both the square well and harmonic potential. Try to explain these plots.

Plot of eigenstate energy difference vs quantum number n for the harmonic potential (last task in handout). Try to explain this plot.

Important: Discussion of accuracy of your results: What limits the accuracy? Can you compute the energy eigenstates with arbitrarily small precision? 

The lab report should not include:
A detailed discussion of the algorithm - this is given in the handout - nor of quantum mechanics nor the Schr√∂dinger equation. You can keep the introduction brief and focus on the method and results.

Your complete source code. However, do show snippets of code that are relevant.
